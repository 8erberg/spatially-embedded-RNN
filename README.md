# The spatially-embedded recurrent neural network
This repository describes the implementation of spatially-embedded recurrent neural networks (seRNNs). The main results are reported in our preprint "Spatially-embedded recurrent neural networks reveal widespread links between structural and functional neuroscience findings" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.17.516914v1). More results are forthcoming. We currently provide two example implementations:
- seRNN_demo.ipynb: Baseline implementation of seRNNs using rate-based networks in Tensorflow with a simple cognitive task. This implementation was used in the preprint above.
- seRSNN_demo.ipynb: Additional implementation using spiking networks in PyTorch and the DVS128 Gesture Dataset to replicate seRNN findings under new training regime.
